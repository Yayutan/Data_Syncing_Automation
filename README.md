# Cross Platform Data Syncing Automation
RPA implemented with UiPath that syncs data in local excel files to corresponding tables on SharePoint
Please be aware that this only works for the partcular files and SharePoint lists that I am working on this summer  
For confidentiality, excel spreadsheets are not included  
Note:  
* The XML diagrams are made using draw.io, and contain a graphical explanation of the workflow
* There is a mp4 file that demonstrates the result of this project
* Also, there is a ppt with the media materials I created and some conclusions I drew from this project
