# Data_Syncing_Automation  
Syncing data in local file system to file on SharePoint using RPA(UiPath)  
Please be aware that this only works for the partcular files and SharePoint lists that I am working on this summer  
For confidentiality, excel spreadsheets are not included  
The XML diagrams are made using draw.io, and contain a graphical explanation of the workflow  
That's all, enjoy : )
