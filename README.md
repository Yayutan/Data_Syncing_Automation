# Data_Syncing_Automation  
Syncing data in local file system to file on SharePoint using RPA(UiPath)  
Please be aware that this only works for the partcular files and SharePoint lists that I am working on this summer  
For confidentiality, excel spreadsheets are not included
Note:
* The XML diagrams are made using draw.io, and contain a graphical explanation of the workflow
* There is a mp4 file that demonstrates the result of this project
* Also, there is a ppt with the media materials I created and some conclusions I drew from this project(still working on it...)
That's all, enjoy : )
